    "Question answering (QA) encompasses a variety of approaches, but in this section, we'll delve into the realm of extractive question answering. This involves formulating questions about a document and pinpointing the answers as text segments within the document itself.\n",
    "\n",

These models synthesize information in a manner akin to text summarization, generating comprehensive responses that go beyond simply extracting snippets from the provided text."

Since we padded all samples to the maximum length, a data collator is not required, making the metric computation the primary focus. The complexity lies in post-processing the model's predictions into spans of text within the original examples. Once this is accomplished, the metric provided by the ðŸ¤— Datasets library will handle most of the evaluation tasks.\n",

    "#### Post-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will generate logits for the start and end positions of the answer within the input IDs. The post-processing stage will follow a similar approach to the one we employed there, so here's a brief recap of the steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Masking Irrelevant Tokens:** We'll mask the start and end logits corresponding to tokens that fall outside the context. This ensures that the model's attention is focused solely on the relevant portions of the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probabilistic Conversion:** We'll convert the start and end logits into probabilities using a softmax function. This transformation effectively scales the logits into a range between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of each token being the start or end of the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scoring Answer Spans:** We'll assign a score to each pair of `(start_token, end_token)` by multiplying the corresponding start and end probabilities. This scoring mechanism prioritizes answer spans with higher confidence levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Identifying the Optimal Answer Span:** We'll identify the pair of `(start_token, end_token)` with the highest score, ensuring that the `start_token` precedes the `end_token`. This pair represents the most likely and valid answer span.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we can effectively extract the most probable answer span from the model's predictions, enabling us to interpret and evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance, we'll introduce slight modifications to the process since we only need to identify the predicted answer and not calculate actual scores. Consequently, we can bypass the softmax step, streamlining the process. To further enhance speed, we'll limit our analysis to the top `n_best` logits, eliminating the need to evaluate all possible `(start_token, end_token)` pairs. With `n_best=20`, we'll focus on the 20 most promising logits. Since we're not using softmax, the scores will be represented as logit scores, obtained by summing the start and end logits (rather than multiplying them, as the rule `log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)` states).\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this approach, we'll utilize predictions generated by the default QA pipeline model on a small subset of the validation set. We can employ the same processing function as before; as it relies on the global constant `tokenizer`, we simply need to replace this object with the tokenizer of the model we intend to use temporarily.\n",
